# Bunnies
## Welcome to Bunny Bliss! 🐇✨
This is my beginner-friendly web development project where I bring adorable bunnies to life! Built as a fun exploration into coding, this website showcases a simple yet charming design that reflects my first steps into creating interactive and visually appealing web pages.

I’m just getting started on my coding journey, and this project is all about learning, experimenting, and sharing the joy of progress. Whether you're here for the bunnies or curious to see what a beginner can create, I hope you enjoy this little hop into web development!

Feel free to explore, provide feedback, and join me as I continue to grow. 💻🌟
